define("CRITTER_CONDITIONS_NOTE","These conditions are an integral part of the contract to the exclusion of the conditions of the customer. Any departures from these conditions must be agreed in writing.\nThese general conditions of sale are applicable solely between businesses in commercial transactions that give rise to the delivery of goods or the delivery of services in the context of the pursuit of a self-employed professional or economic activity.");
define("CRITTER_CONDITIONS_TITLE", "General Conditions of Sale");
define("CRITTER_CONDITIONS","1. The goods or services are delivered as indicated in the invoice or on the order form.
2. The goods or services are delivered within the period of time indicated on the order form, having regard for the usual tolerances specific to the nature of the industry or trade.
3. The delivery is made at the address of seller, unless agreed otherwise in writing.
4. The goods are shipped at the costs and risk of purchaser.
5. Complaints relating to the goods delivered or the services supplied cannot be entertained should they not reach us in writing within seven days of the delivery. Latent defects should be reported to us without delay following their discovery.
6. Our deliveries are payable in cash (or: our deliveries are payable at the latest within seven days of the invoice date, unless otherwise agreed in writing).
7. The delivered merchandise remains our property until such time that the price (principal, costs and interest)  has been paid in full. The acquiring party bears the risks as of the time of delivery. He must preserve the goods in a good condition. In the event of a failure to pay the invoice on the seventh day after a reminder has been sent by registered posted letter, the contract can be terminated by us by means of a statement sent by simple registered letter, where the foregoing applies without prejudicing any payment of compensation by the defaulting purchaser.
8. In the event of the non-payment of the invoice on the due date interest shall be claimed as of right and without formal notice of default. This interest for late payment is charged on the basis of the reference interest rate of the European Central Bank.
9. Moreover the outstanding amount of the invoice shall without any formal notice of default be increased by 10%, with a minimum increase of EUR 25, by way of penalty for extrajudicial collection costs and contractual loss, without prejudice to all other relevant collection costs.
10. All our contracts are governed by Belgian law.");
